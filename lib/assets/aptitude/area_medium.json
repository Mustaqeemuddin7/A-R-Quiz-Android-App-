      "question": "The length of a rectangle is increased by 20% and its breadth is decreased by 10%. Find the percentage change in its area.",
      "options": [
        "8% increase",
        "10% increase",
        "8% decrease",
        "10% decrease"
      ],
      "correct_option": "8% increase",
      "explanation": "New area = 1.2 × 0.9 = 1.08 times the original ⇒ 8% increase."

      "explanation": "Area of path = π(R² - r²) = (22/7)(16² - 14²) = (22/7)(256 - 196) = (22/7)×60 = 188.57 ≈ 176 sq. m."

      "correct_option": "12 m",
      "explanation": "Let width = x ⇒ length = 2x ⇒ outer dimensions = (x + 5) × (2x + 5) = 656 ⇒ 2x² + 15x + 25 = 656 ⇒ 2x² + 15x - 631 = 0 ⇒ x = 12 m."
