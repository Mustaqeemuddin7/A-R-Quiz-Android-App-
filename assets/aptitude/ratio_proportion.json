          "correct_option": "20",
          "explanation": "If 3 parts = 30 boys, then 1 part = 10. Since girls are 2 parts, number of girls = 2 × 10 = 20"

          "explanation": "Total parts = 4 + 1 = 5 parts. If 5 parts = 25 liters, then 1 part = 5 liters. Milk is 4 parts, so milk = 4 × 5 = 20 liters"
